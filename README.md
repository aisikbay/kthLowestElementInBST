# kth Lowest Binary Search Tree Element
Problem: Given an array of integers and an integer k, construct a balanced binary search tree from the array and find the k<sup>th</sup> lowest element.
This approach constructs the tree from the pre-sorted increasing array, then traverses the tree to print it and find its k<sup>th</sup> lowest element.
